\title{How to Automatically Detect Bugs\\on Programs based on C++11?}
\maketitle

Software reliability is an \sout{important concern}~\textcolor{red}{this term is too vague, please, express yourself better} in the modern world~\textcolor{red}{explain in this first phrase why reliability is important in the modern world}. Due to the greater dependence of computer systems, its efficiency and safety are fundamental concerns to avoid accidents and damages in our daily lives~\textcolor{red}{you should merge this phrase to the previous one and give an example of accidents/damages}. In order to achieve the reliability~\textcolor{red}{be careful with powerful statements like that one, are you sure that you wanna to achieve the reliability?} of \sout{these}~\textcolor{red}{C++11} programs,~\textcolor{red}{the beginning of this phrase sounds odd in English, please, re-write it} verification tools demonstrate to be a powerful tool \sout{to test}~\textcolor{red}{verification tools test features?} its features. \sout{For this application}~\textcolor{red}{replace it for another conjunction or a better connector}, we are using the ESBMC++ \sout{software verifier}~\textcolor{red}{stop using ``software verifier'', use ``verification tools'' instead}, developed by researchers from the System and Software Verification Laboratory at the Federal University of Amazonas. 

This tool has an automatic \sout{and efficient} approach to check programs written in C++98\sout{programming language}. \sout{The operation of }ESBMC++ \sout{works on}~\textcolor{red}{applies a technique named bounded} model checking, which \sout{is the process of} exhaustively and automatically checks proprieties of a system according to a given specification. In this case, it is particularly hard to handle C++ programs due to the complex language features, such as inheritance and polymorphism. \sout{To overcome these problems}~\textcolor{red}{the complexity is not the reason why we use OM, please, re-rewrite it}, ESBMC++ uses an operational model, a simplified abstraction of the standard C++ libraries \sout{representing the classes, methods, and other features similar to the actual structure}.

The main challenge of the verification process is to handle large programs and to support the complex features that the languages has to offer~\textcolor{red}{what about C++11?}. The development of a comprehensive and reliable operational model is important to guarantee the efficiency of the tool \sout{along with the use of satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) to guide the checking process}~\textcolor{red}{How SMT is related to OM?}.

The development of the ESBMC++ \sout{was made}~\textcolor{red}{avoid passive voice} from an integration with an already existing model checker, the ESBMC~\textcolor{red}{this phrase is useless}. As results of experiments with most of the features of C++, the tool demonstrated to be able to handle inheritances, polymorphisms and exception handling.~\textcolor{red}{this paragraph does not add anything important to the text, re-write it or remove it}

The improvement of software verifiers such as ESBMC++ can have a huge impact on software development. Such tools could avoid errors, prevent failures and accidents in industries, transport systems, companies, saving money and peopleÄôs lives~\textcolor{red}{You didn't explain why is important and this phrase is not appropriate}. The next step in this research is to give the verification tools~\textcolor{red}{all of them?} the ability to check programs built on \sout{newer versions of C++, such as the} C++11. This version contains new features in the standard library such as arraysÄù, forward list and other libraries that need to be implemented on ESBMC++ as new operational models~\textcolor{red}{you need to re-write this phrase}.
